## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
react-with-memory/
  node_modules/
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    components/
      Card/
      Header/
      Wrapper/
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
  package.json

```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.
